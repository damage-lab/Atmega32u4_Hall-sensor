# Atmega32u4_Hall-sensor
 measure the speed of a wheel. You could attach a magnet to the wheel and place a Hall sensor nearby. Each time the wheel rotates, the magnet passes by the sensor, and the sensor's output changes. The ATmega32U4 can count the number of times the sensor's output changes per second, and use that to calculate the wheel's speed.
